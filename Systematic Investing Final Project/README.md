# Computer-Driven Investing for Sector ETFs

In this project we aim to predict and trade Sector ETFs using fundamental analysis and a variety of strategies/feature engineering techniques with promising results.

The algortihm in the first strategy is a python-solution that optimizes 3 fundamental thresholds for each individual Sector.
This was done on past data to avoid overfitting, using the optimized thresholds as a basis for the backtesting period.
