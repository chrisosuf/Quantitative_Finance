# Computer-Driven Investing Report

In this project we aim to predict and trade off of Sector ETFs using fundamental analysis in a variety of strategies
and feature engineering techniques with promising results.

The algortihm in the first strategy optimizes the 3 fundamental thresholds to trade with for each individual Sector.
This was done on past data to avoid overfitting, using the optimized thresholds as a basis for the backtesting period.
